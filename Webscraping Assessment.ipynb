    "## Steps Taken & Challenges Faced:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once the driver has been implemented and the IIMA main webpage opens, we can see a 3 bar navigation icon on the top-right corner of the page. My code uses Selenium to interact with such elements. In this case, it clicks it.\n",
    "- A drop down menu opens up wherein our code hovers on the \"Faculty & Research\" option to make the next drop down visible. There were challenges in doing this since the two lists almost overlap each other but I resolved it by putting a code that would scroll to the right once it reaches the \"Faculty & Research\" option.\n",
    "- From here, we will click on the \"Our Faculty\" link\n",
    "- In the new webpage, we iterate (loop) through all the page numbers (as can be seen on the bottom of the webpage)\n",
    "- For each page, the code opens each faculty profile and webscrapes their name, profession, expertise area, educational background and research work.\n",
    "- Some more challenges I resolved included things like adding a scrolling element for each faculty page for it to load all the elements necessary for webscraping, adding wait times and finding unique class/tag names.\n",
    "- Another challenge was that some faculty pages did not have education and research area elements so I had to make a counter for it in order to let my code loop run all the way till the end\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE: Unlike the SHERNI website, there wasn't any specific \"year\" or \"university\" element that I could scrape separately. The educational background element has the combined information.**"
